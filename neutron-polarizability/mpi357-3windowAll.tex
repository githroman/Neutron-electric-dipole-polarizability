\subsubsection{Electric polarizability $\alpha_E$ including all diagrams in the 3-window analysis}
\label{3573wAll}
The 3-window analysis was also performed for all diagrams, connected and disconnected,
shown in~\ref{fig:diagrams}. The correlator ratios $R_2(t)$ are shown in figure~\ref{fig:Correlators3wAll}. 
The plots roughly correspond to the cubic behavior depicted in~\ref{fig:CubicAll}.
 The inflection points and extremal slopes were obtained for 
 the fitting ranges 5 to 7, 4 to 8, 3 to 9, as shown in~\ref{tab:ExtremaMultiPointAll}.

The electric polarizability for all diagrams was calculated from 
the results in table~\ref{tab:ExtremaMultiPointAll}
for the selected fitting ranges, with and without the Foldy-Wouthuysen contribution.
Table~\ref{tab:FullPolarizabilities} shows the electric polarizability 
measurements for the ``multi point" dataset.
